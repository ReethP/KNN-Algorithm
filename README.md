# A modification of the KNN Algorithm used in Solar Weather Forecasting

How to use
 - Install anaconda python
 - Open an anaconda terminal
 - move to the file location of the program (cd <name of file folder> example cd Desktop)
 - create a folder named "data" (without quotation marks) in the same folder as the program
 - name the training dataset training_weather_forecasting.csv
 - name the testing dataset which contains 24 hours worth of data as testing_weather_forecasting.csv
 - ensure that both datasets follow the format included in example.csv
 - run the program by typing python KNN_Algorithm.py in the anaconda terminal
 - go to the data folder and open output.csv for the 72 hour forecast

Follow the format of the example.csv for both training and testing datasets or else the program will read the document wrong
Name the training dataset as training_weather_forecasting.csv
Name the testing dataset as testing_weather_forecasting.csv

The program will output output.csv in the data folder. Which contains the weather forecast for the next 72 hours.
If you want to rerun the program. Make sure to close the output.csv file or else the program will not be able to run.
